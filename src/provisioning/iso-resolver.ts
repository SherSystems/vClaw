/**
 * Resolves Windows ISOs via Microsoft fwlink IDs (e.g. the

 * that 302 to time-limited Azure blob URLs).

 *   1. Map OsTarget -> fwlink ID + edition.
 *   2. HEAD/GET the fwlink, follow the redirect chain.
 *   3. Capture final URL, sha256 (from the Microsoft hash page).
 *   4. Detect form-bypass requirements (consumer ISOs gate on JS).
