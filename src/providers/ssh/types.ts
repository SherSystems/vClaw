/**
 * Per-target overrides applied AFTER the base classifier produces a tier.
 * Two shapes are supported and may be combined:
 *
 *   - `default`: a floor tier applied to every command on this target.
 *     If the classifier returns a tier strictly lower than `default`,
 *     the result is bumped up. This lets an operator declare a target
 *     "this host is risky_write even for normally-safe commands"
 *     (e.g. a fragile production box where even an `ls` deserves a
 *     human in the loop).
 *
 *   - `commands`: a per-tag override map. Keys match either the
 *     classifier `match` tag (e.g. `"systemctl-mutate"`) OR the
 *     trimmed command string verbatim. Values are the tier to apply.
 *     Lets an operator unlock a specific allowlisted command on an
 *     otherwise-locked target, OR bump a specific safe command up.
 *
 * Overrides can lower a tier (e.g. unlock `systemctl restart nginx`
 * to `safe_write` on a sandbox host) but they can NEVER lower a
 * `never`-tier classification — that one is non-negotiable.
